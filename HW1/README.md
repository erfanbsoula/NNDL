# NNDL - Homework 1

### 1. McCulloch-Pitts Neuron

In this section we explored manual weight assignment for a multi-output network of McCulloch-Pitts neurons and evaluated the network with the assigned weights in python.

### 2. Adaline and Madaline

In this section we mimplemented Adaline and Madaline algorithms and explored their performance.

### 3. Auto-Encoders for Classification

In this section, we implemented the research article titled ["LMAE: A large margin Auto-Encoders for classification"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168417302013). We trained an Auto-Encoder network and used the Encoder to extract features from the data. Then we trained a simple fully-connected network to classify the data in the feature space.  

### 4. Multi-Layer Perceptron

In this section, we used MLP networks to predict car prices. First, we preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized the dataset. Then, we explored various MLP models with Dropout layers added after each hidden layer to mitigate overfitting. Furthermore, we explored different loss functions and optimizers to identify the best combination for our regression problem.
