# NNDL - Homework 5

### 1. Question Answering System

In this section, we developed a persian question answering system using Transformers as the core architecture and adapting them for Question Answering task. Our approach involves fine-tuning two distinct Transformers, namely [ParsBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12515) and [ALBERT-Persian](https://github.com/m3hrdadfi/albert-persian), on a Persian Question Answering Dataset ([PQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06219)).

### 2. Image Classification using Vision Transformers

In this section, we conducted a comparative study of two different architectures for image classification: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). We followed a research article titled ["Investigating Transfer Learning Capabilities of Vision Transformers and CNNs by Fine-Tuning a Single Trainable Block"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05270). We implemented the code based on the techniques described in the research paper titled ["Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877). VGG-19 (CNN) and DeiT (ViT) were selected for this study.
