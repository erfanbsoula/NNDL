# NNDL - Homework 6

### 1. Variational AutoEncoder

In this section, we implemented and trained a Variational AutoEncoder network and compared conducted a comparative analysis of its dimension reduction performance in contrast to traditional dimension reduction methods, including AutoEncoders, Isomap, and PCA. The procedure was based on a research article titled ["Empirical Comparison between Autoencoders and Traditional Dimensionality Reduction Methods"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8791727). All methods were evaluated based on their impact on KNN classifier accuracy within their respective latent spaces.

### 2. Conditional Deep Convolutional GAN

In this section, we implement Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (cDCGAN) by referencing two articles titled ["Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) and ["Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). Using this generative model, we create a new dataset by randomly selecting data from the original dataset and supplementing it with data generated by the cDCGAN. This hybrid dataset is carefully constructed to maintain the same size as the original dataset, combining elements from both sources. Then, we proceed to conduct a comparative evaluation of ResNet classification performance on the original and new datsets.
