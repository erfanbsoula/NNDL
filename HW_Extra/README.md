# NNDL - Extra Homework

### 1. Cryptocurrency Price Estimation

In this section, we trained various models, utilizing LSTM and GRU architectures, for the purpose of estimating Cryptocurrency Prices. Our goal was to compare the performance of these models based on a research article titled  ["Deep Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Scheme With Inter-Dependent Relations"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355022452_Deep_Learning-Based_Cryptocurrency_Price_Prediction_Scheme_With_Inter-Dependent_Relations). To create our dataset for this project, we manually collected historical data for two cryptocurrencies (Litecoin and Monero) and preprocessed them to use as a dataset for our experiments.

### 2. Violence Detection in Videos

In this section, we trained a deep neural network to detect violence in videos, aligning our approach with the research article titled ["Video Surveillance for Violence Detection Using Deep Learning"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338559695_Video_Surveillance_for_Violence_Detection_Using_Deep_Learning). Our model was built upon the ResNet architecture, and we utilized the Hockey Fight Dataset for training and evaluating the model.
